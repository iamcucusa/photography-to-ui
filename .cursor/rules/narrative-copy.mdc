# Narrative & Copy Rules

## Narrative Intent

One story only:

“Visual systems observed in photography are translated into product decisions,
calmly, intentionally, and directly in code.”

This is a thinking narrative, not branding.

---

## Tone

Copy must be:
- editorial
- observational
- declarative
- quietly technical

Avoid:
- marketing language
- emotional adjectives
- enthusiasm
- long explanations
- first-person storytelling

---

## Copy Length

- No paragraph longer than 2 short lines
- Most copy readable in <3 seconds
- If unsure, remove words

---

## Primary Panel Copy (Use verbatim in first draft)

**Headline**
Photography translated into product UI.

**Supporting line**
Mood, rhythm, and hierarchy expressed through code.

**Inline actions**
- Inspect layout decisions
- View interaction constraints

---

## Insight Rail (Initial Set)

- Typography leads the interface.  
  Layout follows reading, not decoration.

- Color is structural.  
  Accent is reserved for intent and focus.

- Photography is context, not content.  
  It informs decisions without demanding attention.

- Minimal scrolling by design.  
  Exploration happens through interaction.

- This is not a design system.  
  It is a controlled starting point.

# Photography → Product UI

A design-in-code exploration translating photographic inputs into product UI decisions. Focused on typography, color structure, layout rhythm, and interaction constraints—implemented directly in code.

## What this is

- Small, intentional coded UI surface
- Focus on typography, color roles, layout rhythm, interaction
- Minimal scrolling; interaction-driven exploration
- Designed to be iterated on

## What this is not

- Not a full design system
- Not a component library
- Not a scroll-heavy case study

## Principles (current iteration)

- Typography leads hierarchy
- Color is structural (accent reserved for intent/focus)
- Photography is context, not content
- Interaction over scrolling
- Constraints first; extraction later

## Tech

- React + TypeScript
- Modern CSS with variables/tokens
- Accessibility-conscious focus states and contrast

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
